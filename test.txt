1.
SELECT employees.DEPARTMENT_ID, departments.DEPARTMENT_NAME, SUM(employees.SALARY) AS 'Monthly Total Salary'

FROM employees

JOIN departments ON departments.DEPARTMENT_ID = employees.DEPARTMENT_ID

GROUP BY employees.DEPARTMENT_ID

ORDER BY SUM(employees.SALARY);

2.
SELECT employees.JOB_ID, jobs.JOB_TITLE, COUNT(employees.EMPLOYEE_ID) AS 'Employee Count'

FROM employees

JOIN jobs ON jobs.JOB_ID = employees.JOB_ID

GROUP BY employees.JOB_ID

ORDER BY COUNT(employees.EMPLOYEE_ID);

3.
-- From the data, I GUESS manager_id equals employee_id(foreign key), so I can find the manager name from the employee table itself.

SELECT employees.MANAGER_ID, CONCAT(managers.FIRST_NAME, ' ', managers.LAST_NAME) as 'Manager Name', IFNULL(departments.DEPARTMENT_NAME, '-') AS 'Department', COUNT(employees.EMPLOYEE_ID) AS 'Managed Employees'


FROM employees


JOIN employees managers ON employees.MANAGER_ID = managers.EMPLOYEE_ID


LEFT JOIN departments ON departments.MANAGER_ID = employees.MANAGER_ID


GROUP BY employees.MANAGER_ID;


SELECT employees.MANAGER_ID, CONCAT(managers.FIRST_NAME, ' ', managers.LAST_NAME) as 'Manager Name', IFNULL(departments.DEPARTMENT_NAME, '-') AS 'Department', COUNT(employees.EMPLOYEE_ID) AS 'Managed Employees'
FROM employees
JOIN employees managers ON employees.MANAGER_ID = managers.EMPLOYEE_ID
LEFT JOIN departments ON departments.MANAGER_ID = employees.MANAGER_ID
GROUP BY employees.MANAGER_ID
ORDER BY COUNT(employees.EMPLOYEE_ID) DESC LIMIT 1;
